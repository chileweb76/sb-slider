Three image slider. 

== Description ==

Carousel slider that displays a large main image that has a title, content, and links. Along each side are smaller images showing previous and next images.  The links are capable of being connected to external locations such as stores with products. There are six available in two rows of three. They can be individually in whatever location that is desired. 

It is required that a thumbnail regnerating plugin is used before first use, otherwise the main image will default to the full image size. This will generate the main image thumbnail. Such plugins would be like the recommended Regnerate Thumbnails by Alex Mills. There are others that dan be used like Force Regenerate Thumbnails by Exacly WWW.
